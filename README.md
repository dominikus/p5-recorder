## Alternatives
You might also want to use:
* [CCapture](https://github.com/spite/ccapture.js/) hooks into `requestAnimationFrame` to arrive at a similarly smooth result and let's you export webm and gif among others.
* [p5js-gif-recoder](https://github.com/datramt/p5js-gif-recorder) uses CCapture to export gifs directly from p5. 
* [p5.createLoop](https://github.com/mrchantey/p5.createLoop) creates loops and exports them as gifs from p5.
